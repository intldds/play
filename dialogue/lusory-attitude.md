A: I don’t understand how you can find enjoyment in something that seems so difficult.

B: What do you mean?

A: By all measures, what you do takes a lot of discipline, and effort. At any point, you could injure yourself. Not to mention, this is physically draining, and you will likely never make a living from running, or even be the fastest runner. Why not dedicate yourself to things that are conventionally more enjoyable?

B: What you say is true, it requires a lot of effort, I could injure myself, and I will likely never rank. 

A: So why do you do it? Surely there is some aspect that gives you satisfaction.

B: There is certainly satisfaction and enjoyment that comes from having met some benchmark, yet I can derive satisfaction from the act itself

A: How so? I’m not convinced there’s a way to frame this as enjoyable. 

B: I can frame running as a medium I can freely explore. While there are things I could quantify like setting personal records, I can find delight in the immeasurable parts. 

A: ...

B: At some point, performing better will become much harder the better I get, so I have to find other things to get joy in because I will eventually not be able to beat my prior records due to my own physical limits. 

A: Hmm. I notice a lot of the parts of running that bring you joy come from yourself. 

B: Exactly! I think that extrinsic motivation is superficial, and my commitment to this is a testament to the deep personal satisfaction I get from running. 

A: Are you saying that there isn’t satisfaction from extrinsic factors?

B: I’m not making that claim, but what makes this act play as opposed to work is what gives me the most joy from running are the intrinsic factors. 

A: Interesting...
